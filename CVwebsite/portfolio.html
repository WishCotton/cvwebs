            <p>These are some examples of work I've done through pradominatly creative
                coding and some 3D modeling. I began my interest in creative coding through
                working with processing in community college back in the states. A big part
                of why I chose to take the media design programe at vic was because I would
                be able to continue studying creative coding. While at vic I furthered my 
                knowledge of creative coding through P5JS which helped segway me into interest
                in HTML and CSS. I also started combining some of my coded work with image editing
                and exploring 3D modelling.

                <p>This is a coded peice I created, the code rotates a feild of dots
                    as their color changes resulting in this image.

                <p>This is an image from an art gallery I made in unreal engine. 
                    The idea was to make 3 dementional versions of 2d artwork I had made previously.</p>

                <img src = "IMG_1574 (1).jpg" width = "100%">
                <p>This was a school project where we were assigned to make a poster for a hypathetical concert.
                    As I used to make all the posters for my highschool band it felt right up my ally. I used pen and 
                    watercolor.

                <p>This is another photograph layered over a drawing I made with my drawing programe. 
                    This image was a screen shot from a glitch on facebook. I've always been facinated 
                    with internet art, especially peices that enphisize glitches.

                <p>This is a coded image created by feilds of lines overlapping. It displayes 
                    pretty differently at different sizes with the lines creating different 
                    patterns.

                <p>This is another drawing I made with an old drawing progam I wrote.
                    Continuing on the theme of leaning into my mistakes I was trying
                    to create a new brush and instead created these patterns of connecting 
                    lines.

                    and was living in a depressing little hotel room. Boy you can tell I 
                    was having a good time.

                <p>This peice is another example of trying to embrace a glitch or mistake, 
                    I was trying to make an erase function work with a new 3D element I had added to 
                    my programe and the eraser was only eracing one layer on the z axis. I thought 
                    the result was pretty cool and I was never able to recreate it after this.

                <p>This is a drawing I did to be a joke tarot card. I had planned on makeing a full deck
                    but after this card took me many hours I decided against it.

                     drawing programe I wrote (the same drawing programe you can acsses from the main page).
                    The idea was to mix photographes with coded images to create a psycadelic effect.</p>

              <p>This is a video of a program I wrote to draw a random composition based on 
                  specific constraints. There are multiple different lines being drawn in different 
                  colors that move in different was. Some of the lines are constrained to different 
                  parts of the screen or change their behavior based on the section of the screen they 
                  are on. The result is a composition that is different every time but with a similar
                  overarching look.

              <p>This is a video of me using a drawing program I created.
                  The lines are rotated around the center and controlled using the arrow keys
                to create straight lines and get this "tecno" effect.
