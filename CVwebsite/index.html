      <p>I'm Mavis and stuff, 24 years old, runaway American, majored
          in media design. I was interested in doing this course
          because I really like doing coded art and am very interested
          in the tec art scean. I thought that learning more about wed
          design would give me a new medium to explore those interests 
          in and I definetly feel that it did! I'm way more confident
          coding in html and css as well as more confident teaching 
          myself how to do this stuff. If you click on the side bar
          you can take a look at an interactive composition I made to
          get the gist of the other stuff I do.

        <p>I was in an indie rock band for 5 years in which I acted as a band member and manager.
            That doesn't have much to do with web design but it did give me experience plannign events, designing 
            merch and promotional material, and orginizing other people.

            <p>I have been working as a bartender, specifically in craft beer breweries and 
                bars, for the last 4 years. I have a lot of experience working on a team and 
                I know way too much about beer. I also have a lot of experience dealing with 
                a wide range of people.
